/* Probably you wouldnt want to change anything other than values for settings here
or add new attributes to already existing tags
unless you are making changes to the source code like creating an implementation for
a new highlighting language (in which case you would write-compile-link a parser-function
for your new language highlighting + add an entry and specify the tags used by your
parser-function in here) or adding new stuff to the build itself and wishing to make your
new stuff easily configurable in here. */
