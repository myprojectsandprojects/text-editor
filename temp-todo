- 2 marks is not enough. need more! definately improve interface somehow!

- '{' <-> '}' -- ignore '{}' in comments, string-literals, char-literals, ... (scope highlighting and ctrl + p/ü)
- ctrl + shift + p/ü text selection
These features are language specific (Python's scopes are not specified by '{' and '}'. Lua uses different syntax for comments. And if no language is specified they probably shouldnt work at all)

---

- jump '(' -> ')' etc.

---
''
""
()
[]

{} -- jump start/end of scope functionality already handles this
<> -- #include / less than and greater than

jump from start to end

* Should it work when the cursor/character is inside a comment? String? Char-literal?
* Which one's do we want to highlight? We might want to be able to jump from '[' to ']' but we might not want to highlight them.
